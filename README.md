# Wireframe â†’ Planar Polygons (Milestone v1.0)

Rotating 3D wireframe cube that, on button press, projects to 2D and computes the planar subdivision of the projected edges.
The bounded regions (up to 7 depending on orientation) are then separated outward in screen space.

## Notes
- Milestone v1.0 (2025-09-06, America/Chicago).
- Half-edge walk of a planar straight-line graph to extract bounded faces; outer (unbounded) face dropped.
- The UI uses simple inline styles; no Tailwind or other CSS frameworks required.
